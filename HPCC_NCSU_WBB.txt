WBB data workflow

Pull data from Catapult (gps) cloud
integrate WBB data into HPCCupload script
check to see if layout script for WBB_gps are working
check to see if stg  script for WBB_gps are working
	join athleteinfo data with WBB_gps to add athleteid
Integrate changes into build_athlete360 script
	make sure WBB_gps is integrated into spray_build correctly
		WBB_gps file is correctly identified from landing zone, and sprayed into the WBB_gps superfile
	make sure WBB_gps is correctly processed by stg_build
		all data is in the correct format and looks the way it should


Start building scripts to prepare WBB_gps for analysis
	- code for finding averages based on particular types of days
	- code for finding team averages
	- code for analyzing game data
	- possibly more over time based on needs if something doesn't fit into these other codes


Start building dashboard with report tabs in RealBI
	figure out what types of reports we need (daily, weekly, game, etc.)
	figure out how we want to display each element for the different report tabs
		more longitudinal line graphs for weekly vs bars and tables for daily/game
	- game data report
	- report looking at trends over the past week
	- report looking at the difference between different types of practices
	- report looking at a given practice and how it compares to normal for team/each athlete
