WBB data workflow

Pull data from Catapult cloud
integrate WBB data into HPCCupload script
check to see if layout script for WBB_gps are working
check to see if stg  script for WBB_gps are working
	join athleteinfo data with WBB_gps to add athleteid
Integrate changes into build_athlete360 script
	make sure WBB_gps is integrated into spray_build correctly
		WBB_gps file is correctly identified from landing zone, and sprayed into the 			WBB_gps superfile
	make sure WBB_gps is correctly processed by stg_build
		all data is in the correct format and looks the way it should


Start building scripts to prepare WBB_gps for analysis
	- TBD what will need to be done with the data to find the information we need based on future goals for reports in RealBI


Start building dashboard with report tabs in RealBI
	figure out what types of reports we need (daily, weekly, game, etc.)
	figure out how we want to display each element for the different report tabs
		more longitudinal line graphs for weekly vs bars and tables for daily/game
	-TBD more details when we have done more with the data manipulation/analysis
