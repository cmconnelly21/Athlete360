Requirements for finding average time periods in GPS data:

upload data to landing zone
spray data to cluster with starting layout
process data with stage layout

1. Figure out what parts of the data should be included for average time periods. 
(time periods for drills during a practice, sections of a game, etc.)

2. Figure out how many rows of data are needed for the length of time needed for the average.
ex:10 rows/sec
   600 rows/min
   3000 rows/5 min
   6000 rows/10 min
   9000 rows/15 min

3. Find the data points in the right sections of data to find the different time periods. 
Create a count that will cover the amount of rows needed for the time periods for the time, speed, and heart rate columns.

4. Then find the sum of the speed during those time periods to find distance covered.
create a new table that will have the distance covered in a new column.

5. Now find the average speed for those time periods.
create a new table that will include the average speed  in a new column.

6. Now find the average heart rate for those time periods
create a new table that will include the average heart rate in a new column.

7. Create the output for the data.
