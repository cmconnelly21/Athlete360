Requirements for rolling averages in WSOC readiness and trainingload data:

1. Get the input data, and connect it to a file that has every date for the period of data. 
This is to see what days have missing data.

2. Dedup and sort the data based on athlete name and date.

3. Denormalize the data and use count to get median vaules for each athlete based on all data points for the variables that will be averaged.
This is to fill missing data points with the median value.

4. Create a table with the median values and fill all empty records with median values.

5. Make a new count that will create the window for the rolling average. 
This should find the average based on data points from x amount of days, and then move forward by one day for each date.
So if its 5 days, the rolling average data will start on the 6th day and provide an average value based on the previous 5 days.

6. make a new table with the new columns for the rolling averages and then output the data.
