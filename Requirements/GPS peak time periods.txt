Requirements for finding peak time periods in GPS data:

upload data to landing zone
spray data to cluster with starting layout
process data with stage layout

1. join the gps data and rawgps data based on name and drillname.
The join condition should be to join the drillname where the rawgps time is between the drillstarttime and endtime. 
Endtime can be found with the drillstarttime and the drilltotaltime

2Figure out how many rows of data are needed for the length of time needed for the average.
ex:10 rows/sec
   600 rows/min
   3000 rows/5 min
   6000 rows/10 min
   9000 rows/15 min

3. Scan through data in a window of rows equal to the time period you want. 
Create a count field that will number each row and then create a limit value that will cover the 
amount of rows needed for the time periods for the time, speed, and heart rate columns.

4. create fields to hold a sum value for the columns you  want to average.
This should add the values by each row until it hits the set limit.

4. Generate a average value for each combination of that time period for each column of data.
There should be a new value for each row that provides an average for the previous number of rows provided.
This average will be generated based on the sum vaules for the rows set by the limit value.

5. Record what time periods hold those three greatest values.
dedup and sort the data based on the drill name and then take the greatest value based on each column needed.

6. Create the output for the data.
