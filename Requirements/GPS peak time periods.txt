Requirements for finding peak time periods in GPS data:

upload data to landing zone
spray data to cluster with starting layout
process data with stage layout

1. Figure out how many rows of data are needed for the length of time needed for the average.
ex:10 rows/sec
   600 rows/min
   3000 rows/5 min
   6000 rows/10 min
   9000 rows/15 min

2. Scan through data in a window of rows equal to the time period you want. 
Create a count that will cover the amount of rows needed for the time periods for the time, speed, and heart rate columns.

3. Iterate through and find the three greatest average values for each value.
The window should move through one row at a time taking a value for each combo of the # of rows needed and find what combos are the greatest.
There should be three vaules for speed and heart rate.

4. Record what time periods hold those three greatest values.
Take the time periods that the speed and heart rates happened at.

7. Create the output for the data.
